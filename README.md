This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element outside of its valid index range. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code.  This is a valuable example for understanding and preventing common off-by-one errors in array manipulation.
